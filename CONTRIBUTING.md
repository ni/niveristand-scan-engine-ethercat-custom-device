# Getting Started

Multiple projects exist for building the custom device; each project is specific to one target type and requires
the relevant builds of the modules and FXP libraries to be copied into the build directory.

# Testing

Both unit and system tests are provided with the custom device. These tests can be run from within the LabVIEW
project using the [VI Tester](https://github.com/JKISoftware/JKI-VI-Tester) integration, or from the command line
using the `RunVITester` operation provided by the [testing tools](https://github.com/ni/niveristand-custom-device-testing-tools).

Running the system tests locally requires a specific hardware configuration, which will be documented [here].
The IP address of local targets can be overridden at runtime through the creation of an `overrides.ini` file
adjacent to the system definition.
