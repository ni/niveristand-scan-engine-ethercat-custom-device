# Scan Engine and EtherCAT Custom Device

The **Scan Engine and EtherCAT Custom Device** allows users to integrate I/O from several hardware platforms that are not natively supported by VeriStand:

- CompactRIO Chassis with [supported C Series Modules](docs/Supported%20Modules.md)
- NI-9145 EtherCAT Chassis with [supported C Series Modules](docs/Supported%20Modules.md)
- User-Defined Variables on CompactRIO and NI-914x FPGAs
- Generic EtherCAT Slaves (limited support with PDO access only)
- NI Remote I/O Modules

Note that C Series Module support can be difficult to determine, as it depends on how the module is being used. See the list of [supported C Series Modules](docs/Supported%20Modules.md) and the NI documentation for the supported software modes for each module to determine whether the specific module is available in `cRIO Scan Interface mode` or `EtherCAT (Scan Interface) mode`. The best determination of support is whether the module can be added to a chassis in VeriStand's System Explorer.
