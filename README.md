# Scan Engine Custom Device

**Scan Engine Custom Device**  allows users to easily read scanned I/O from C series modules located in a CompactRIO or NI 914x EtherCAT chassis. The add-on also supports custom FPGA personalities to be used with a 914x chassis. From version 4.3, there is support for generic EtherCAT slaves (PDO only). From version 4.4.1, there is support for NI Remote I/O modules as well.
