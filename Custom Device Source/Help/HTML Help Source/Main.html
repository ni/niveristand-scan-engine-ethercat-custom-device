</noscript><h1>Scan Engine and EtherCAT</h1>
<p class="Body">The <strong>Scan Engine and EtherCAT</strong> custom device allows you to communicate with I/O in local and remote chassis using the NI Scan Engine. This is primarily used to communicate with CompactRIO chassis and EtherCAT hardware.</p>
<p class="Body">The <strong>Synchronize NI VeriStand to Scan Engine</strong> checkbox controls whether VeriStand's Primary Control Loop is clocked by the Scan Engine. If you are using DAQ hardware or other timing sources in your system, you should uncheck this box to cause the custom device to execute in a parallel loop (with a rate that is a decimation of the PCL rate). You can configure the rate of the system (and Scan Engine) by going to the Controller settings page.</p>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Automatically discover connected modules</h3>
<p class="Body">To automatically discover modules, click the <strong>Auto-Detect Modules</strong> button. You also can right-click <strong>Scan Engine and EtherCAT</strong> in the configuration tree and select <strong>Auto-Detect Modules</strong> from the shortcut menu. This will find all Local Chassis, EtherCAT masters, slaves, and modules currently connected to your system, and add them to your System Definition.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong><span class="auto-style1">NOTE:</span> </strong>Make sure that the correct IP address is set in the Controller configuration page, your system is currently powered on and running, any EtherCAT masters are set up in MAX, and any EtherCAT slaves are connected and powered on.
The discovery process does not detect any module settings, so you will need to manually check each module added and ensure that the settings are correct. The discovery process also does not currently check whether a custom FPGA personality is currently deployed and running on the target.</p>
<h3>Add a Local Chassis</h3>
<p class="Body">To add a local chassis (such as a CompactRIO chassis), click the <strong>Add Local Chassis</strong> button. You also can right-click <strong>Scan Engine and EtherCAT</strong> in the configuration tree and select <strong>Add Local Chassis</strong> from the shortcut menu. A dialog box will prompt you for the number of slots available in the chassis.</p>
<h3>Add an EtherCAT Master</h3>
<p class="Body">To add a new EtherCAT master, click the <strong>Add EtherCAT Master</strong> button. You also can right-click <strong>Scan Engine and EtherCAT</strong> in the configuration tree and select <strong>Add EtherCAT Master</strong> from the shortcut menu. This will create an EtherCAT master with the next available master ID.</p>
