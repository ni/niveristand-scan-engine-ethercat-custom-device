</noscript><h1>User Variables</h1>
<p class="Body">The <strong>User Variables</strong> section contains all of the User-Defined Variables (UDVs) available in the slave.  The available UDVs will depend on the FPGA personality configured for the slave.</p>
<h2>What do you want to do?</h2>
<h3>Select an FPGA personality</h3>
<p class="Body">To select or change an FPGA personality, click the <strong>Select/Change FPGA Bitfile</strong> button. You also can right-click the EtherCAT Slave in the configuration tree and select <strong>Select/Change FPGA Bitfile</strong> from the shortcut menu.  A dialog box will allow you to select a bitfile (.lvbitx file) for the slave.  This will add all the UDVs from your FPGA personality to your VeriStand configuration.  This will also disable any module slots that were not compiled for scan support (inlcuding slots with modules used in the FPGA code).  Note that this only affects your NI VeriStand configuration, but does not affect what is currently running on the slave.  Use the <strong>Download FPGA</strong> button to deploy the FPGA configuration to the slave.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>NOTE: </strong>To enable a slot for scan engine support in a custom FPGA personality, add any module (ex. NI 9205) in that slot under the "Chassis" section of your LabVIEW project before compiling your FPGA code.
<h3>Clear the FPGA personality and all UDVs</h3>
<p class="Body">To clear the FPGA personality and all UDVs, click the <strong>Clear Configuration</strong> button. You also can right-click the EtherCAT Slave in the configuration tree and select <strong>Clear Configuration</strong> from the shortcut menu.  Note that this only affects your NI VeriStand configuration, but does not affect what is currently running on the slave.  Use the <strong>Revert Slave to Scan Mode</strong> button to reset the slave back to its default image.</p>
<h3>Deploy an FPGA personality to the slave</h3>
<p class="Body">To an FPGA personality, first select a bitfile with the <strong>Seletc/Change FPGA Bitfile</strong> button, then click the <strong>Download FPGA</strong> button. You also can right-click the EtherCAT Slave in the configuration tree and select <strong>Download FPGA</strong> from the shortcut menu.  Downloading an FPGA personality to the target may take several minutes.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Make sure the correct IP address is set in the controller configuration page, your system is currently powered on and running, your Master ID matches the configuration in MAX, and the slave position is correctly set.</p>
<h3>Clear the FPGA personality from the slave</h3>
<p class="Body">To clear the FPGA personality and put the default image back on the slave (which allows scan mode support for all slots), click the <strong>Revert Slave to Scan Mode</strong> button. You also can right-click the EtherCAT Slave in the configuration tree and select <strong>Revert Slave to Scan Mode</strong> from the shortcut menu.  Reverting the slave to its default image can take several minutes.</p>
<p class="Body"><strong>NOTE: </strong>Make sure the correct IP address is set in the controller configuration page, your system is currently powered on and running, your Master ID matches the configuration in MAX, and the slave position is correctly set.</p>
